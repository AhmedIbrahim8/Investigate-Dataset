What do I need to install?<br/>
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
* pandas<br/>
* NumPy<br/>
* Matplotlib<br/>
* csv<br/>
In this project, we'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.<br/>
we'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!<br/>
